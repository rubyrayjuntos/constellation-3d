- 10 minutes

## The 3-Minute Version

**GOSP in three steps:**

1. **Pick a process type:**
   - Storing information? → Use **High Priestess** template
   - Defining rules? → Use **Hierophant** template
   - Chaos becoming order? → Use **Emperor** template
   - Structure becoming complex? → Use **Empress** template

2. **Use the template:**
   - Copy the appropriate template from below
   - Fill in the [BLANKS]
   - Paste into your AI image generator

3. **Evaluate the result:**
   - Did it show the process you intended?
   - Did unexpected properties emerge?
   - If yes → success! If no → refine constraints

**That's it. You're doing GOSP.**

## The Color Code (Know This First)

GOSP uses three colors functionally:

- **🔵 CYAN** = Structure (the rigid parts, scaffolds, architecture)
- **🟣 MAGENTA** = Dynamics (the flexible parts, active zones, chaos)
- **🟡 AMBER** = Coupling (the connection, the pathway, the focal point)

**When to use which:**
- Left side = usually cyan (structure)
- Right side = usually magenta (dynamics)
- Center = usually amber (where they connect)

**Exception:** If you WANT new properties to emerge (like the Empress creating flowers), expect colors beyond these three. That's good - it means the system added information.

## Template 1: High Priestess (Information Storage)

**Use when:** Visualizing potential, unmanifested data, pre-state, storage

```
Generate [YOUR SUBJECT] as quantum information state - 
holographic boundary between potential and actual.

GEOMETRIC TOPOLOGY:
- Perfect bilateral symmetry (centered on vertical axis)
- Two pillars: black (left) and white (right)
- No directional flow (static)

MATERIAL PROPERTIES:
- 70% translucent/holographic
- Interference patterns visible (standing waves)
- Not solid matter, but visible information

ENERGY DISTRIBUTION:
- Cyan glow (left zone)
- Magenta glow (right zone)
- NO amber coupling (the colors don't mix)
- Even, diffuse lighting

SEMANTIC ANCHOR:
This is [YOUR CONCEPT] as superposition - all possibilities 
present but none actualized. The library before the book is opened.
```

**Example:** "Generate a database system as quantum information state..."

---

## Template 2: Hierophant (Architecture/Rules)

**Use when:** Visualizing structure, laws, frameworks, constraints

```
Generate [YOUR SUBJECT] as geometric law manifest - 
the architecture that constrains all processes.

GEOMETRIC TOPOLOGY:
- Vertical axis (ascending)
- Radial symmetry (emanating from center)
- Precise geometric forms (mandalas, sacred geometry, lattices)

MATERIAL PROPERTIES:
- Mix of wireframe and solid (showing structure)
- Crystalline precision
- Immovable, eternal

ENERGY DISTRIBUTION:
- All three colors (cyan, magenta, amber) as structural elements
- Amber at geometric center
- Cyan and magenta as architectural framework

SEMANTIC ANCHOR:
This is [YOUR CONCEPT] as constraint made visible - the coordinate 
system, the laws, the rules that everything else must obey.
```

**Example:** "Generate the laws of thermodynamics as geometric law manifest..."

---

## Template 3: Emperor (Compression/Ordering)

**Use when:** Visualizing chaos becoming order, compression, extraction, filtering

```
Generate [YOUR SUBJECT] as gravitational collapse - chaos 
crystallizing into order.

GEOMETRIC TOPOLOGY:
- Directional flow: RIGHT → LEFT
- Right side: Turbulent magenta field (chaos, plasma, swirling)
- Left side: Crystalline cyan structures (lattices, geometric order)
- Diagonal composition (top-right collapsing to bottom-left)

MATERIAL PROPERTIES:
- Figure: 80% solid (heavy, dense, dark)
- Right side: Translucent chaos
- Left side: Opaque crystalline structures
- Cube or geometric throne

ENERGY DISTRIBUTION:
- Magenta (right): Maximum entropy within bounds
- Amber (center): Compression point, phase boundary
- Cyan (left): Extracted pattern, pure structure
- NO full spectrum (this removes information, doesn't add)

SEMANTIC ANCHOR:
This is [YOUR CONCEPT] as compression - signal extracted from noise, 
pattern crystallized from chaos, order nucleating from disorder.
```

**Example:** "Generate data compression as gravitational collapse..."

---

## Template 4: Empress (Expansion/Creation)

**Use when:** Visualizing growth, creation, expansion, life emerging

```
Generate [YOUR SUBJECT] as materialization in progress - 
structure becoming complexity.

GEOMETRIC TOPOLOGY:
- Directional flow: LEFT → RIGHT
- Left side: Cyan geometric substrate (wireframe, templates, order)
- Right side: Organic abundance (forms, growth, proliferation)
- Horizontal or diagonal expansion

MATERIAL PROPERTIES:
- Figure: 60% solid, 40% showing transformation
- Left side: Geometric precision
- Right side: Organic, flowing, living
- Throne/base: Natural geometry (Fibonacci spirals, fractals)

ENERGY DISTRIBUTION:
- Cyan (left): Structural potential
- Amber (center): Coupling point, creative engine
- Magenta (surrounding): Creative passion field
- FULL SPECTRUM (right): New properties emerge

SEMANTIC ANCHOR:
This is [YOUR CONCEPT] as proliferation - potential becoming actual, 
templates spawning instances, structure enabling function, life emerging.
```

**Example:** "Generate cell division as materialization in progress..."

## Your First Test: Pick One

**Choose a concept to visualize:**
- A computer booting up → Emperor (chaos → order)
- A tree growing → Empress (structure → complexity)
- DNA before expression → High Priestess (information storage)
- The rules of chess → Hierophant (framework)

**Pick the matching template above, fill in the blanks, and run it.**

---

## Evaluating Your Result

Ask yourself:

1. **Constraint Check:**
   - Did it use the right colors in the right places?
   - Did it show the direction you specified (left→right vs right→left)?
   - Did it capture the material properties (solid vs translucent)?

2. **Emergence Check:**
   - Did anything appear you didn't specify?
   - Does it feel like it's showing the actual PROCESS?
   - Does it resonate with the concept?

3. **Transfer Test:**
   - Could you apply the same constraints to a different concept?
   - Would it still make sense?

**If 2/3 checks pass → you did GOSP successfully!**

## Common Mistakes

**❌ Being too vague:**
"Make a mystical energy thing"
→ System has no constraints, produces generic output

**✓ Being specific about relationships:**
"Asymmetric gradient, cyan left, magenta right, amber connecting them"
→ System has clear constraints, produces coherent output

---

**❌ Describing appearance:**
"It should look beautiful and spiritual"
→ Aesthetic goals don't constrain the solution

**✓ Describing physics:**
"Chaos → order phase transition, entropy decreasing locally"
→ Physical constraints do constrain the solution

---

**❌ Forcing every detail:**
"Place a sphere at position (2,3) with radius 1.5 colored #FF00AA"
→ Over-specification makes the system resist

**✓ Specifying relationships:**
"Magenta chaos on right compresses through amber focal point into cyan structure on left"
→ Relationship specification gives system room to solve

---

## Next Steps

**After your first test:**

1. **Try the other templates** - See how they differ
2. **Mix concepts** - What if you combined Emperor + Empress?
3. **Apply to your domain** - Translate your work into GOSP constraints
4. **Share your results** - Post them and explain your constraints

**Ready to go deeper?**
- Read the full [GOSP_Specification_v1.md](GOSP_Specification_v1.md)
- Study the [worked examples](GOSP_Specification_v1.md#worked-examples)
- Join the community [link TBD]

## Quick Reference Card

**Print or screenshot this:**

```
GOSP QUICK REFERENCE

COLORS:
🔵 Cyan = Structure (95%, rigid, left often)
🟣 Magenta = Dynamics (5%, flexible, right often)
🟡 Amber = Coupling (connection, center often)

STATES:
High Priestess = Information storage (symmetric, static)
Hierophant = Architecture/rules (radial, structural)
Emperor = Compression (RIGHT→LEFT, chaos→order)
Empress = Expansion (LEFT→RIGHT, structure→life)

REMEMBER:
- Specify relationships, not absolutes
- Asymmetry = directionality (something is happening)
- Symmetry = stasis (storage or rules)
- Emergence = validation (if new properties appear, it worked)
```

**That's it! You're ready to GOSP.**

Go generate something and see what emerges. 🦁⚛️✨
